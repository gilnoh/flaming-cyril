1) Intro: very short (1/2 page)
  - TE, state of the art, EOP, remaining problems
2) "Multi-level alignment" (1 1/2 page)
   MOTIVATION:
  * Alignments as "universal (un-)relatedness indicators"
  * "Firewall" between relatedness processing and TE decision
    - extensibility
    - multilinguality
  * STRUCTURE OF EDA:
   - aligners + feature computers + standard supervised learning
3) Implementation and Evaluation (1 1/2 page)
  * THIS IS A PILOT STUDY TO TEST THE POTENTIAL OF THE ARCHITECTURE.
   - small set of aligners. (those available for all languages)
   - small set of features. (those applicable to all langauges)
   - evaluation on one dataset (RTE exists for all languages)
4) Conclusion (1/2 page)
   * Results: it works! May not be as good as best alignment-based systems
     BUT is extensible, robust, and multilingual
   * AND it is available and anyone can use it, not some research prototype (!!!)


* Intro 

(introduction outline)

- TE, and it promises a roll of generic semantic engine. 
- It matures, available as open source, can use as off-the-shelf
  engine. 
- However, remaining problem: essential algorithmic part - closed box. 
- (example, it is hard...) 
- In this paper, we propose a solution for this matter, based on
  multiple alignment, work as firewall. This results in extensible,
  multilingual entailment alignment engine. 
- We report the result on multi-lingual RTE data set, and also
  application task applied on multiple language. 
- The resulting entailment engine, surprisingly well against
  state-of-the-art open source TE engines. 


* Multi-level alignment 

- Figure outline? 
- Diff -- traditional alignment-based approach. 
  + Alignment, alignment selection, feature extraction, decision. 
  + The problem of this case: 
  + Multi-level alignment: various different layers of alignments. 

- What's new is: no longer tightly coupled. Pre-processing, EDA and
  knowledge resources. Various linguistic processing can be
  represented in the form of alignment. (common, also not so common) 

- Decoupling alignment "level" from entailment algorithm. =>
  + the figure should somehow show 2 step into 3 steps. 

- The gains 
  + firewall -- aligners just do align 
  + extension,  multilinguality. 

* Implementation and Evaluation 
- "this is Pilot-study" 
- small set of aligners (for all languages) 
- small set of features (again, language independent) 
- evaluation on RTE3 
- evaluation on application data 

* Conclusion 
- Results: it works! May not be as good as best alignment-based
  systems BUT is extensible, robust, and multilingual 
- AND it is available and anyone can use it, not some research
  prototype (!!!)
