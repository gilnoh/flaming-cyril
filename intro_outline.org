(introduction outline)

- TE, and it promises a roll of generic semantic engine. 
- It matures, available as open source, can use as off-the-shelf
  engine. 
- However, remaining problem: essential algorithmic part - closed box. 
- (example, it is hard...) 
- In this paper, we propose a solution for this matter, based on
  multiple alignment, work as firewall. This results in extensible,
  multilingual entailment alignment engine. 
- We report the result on multi-lingual RTE data set, and also
  application task applied on multiple language. 
- The resulting entailment engine, surprisingly well against
  state-of-the-art open source TE engines.
